<h4>Blog... Project Related Experiments 1 </h4>
<hr />
<p>
    This week, I have started working on the components of my project.
    <br/> My project is similar to a web application like Quora or Stackoverflow or reddit where users can post questions, links or other useful information. Other users can view this information and can upvote/downvote, add comments and follow some users.
</p>
<h5> Setting up the Schema </h5>
<p>
    I started off with designing the schema for my database. I constructed the schema to maintain users, their posts, categories for each post and comments for each post. 
</p>
<h5>Setting up the Navigation Menu</h5>
<p>
    In this experiment, I setup the navigation menu functionality which allows a user to register, login, logout and view the home page.
    <br /> The usernames and passwords are retreived from the database created earlier. I used passport for authentication. When the user logs in, he can view his profile which is restricted based on whether he is logged in or not.
    When a user registers, his details are entered into the user database as created earlier.
</p>
<h5> Display Posts from the database</h5>
<p>
    In this experiment, I setup the Home page which displays all the posts from the database and orders the posts in order of their upvotes.
    <br/> I have made this information public, irrespective of whether the user has logged in or not.
</p>
<h5> Search Bar </h5>
<p>
    In this experiment, I created a search bar which is used to search the database based on the user's input and display posts which match that particular search query.
</p>
<h5> Upvote and Downvote</h5>
<p>
    In this experiment, I have created the functionality for an authenticated logged in user to upvote or downvote a post. I have added two bootstrap glyphicons for the upvote and downvote symbols.
</p>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>This week was the best week so far! I started working on my project and have now built my home page functionality. I am yet to style it since I'm currently focusing on getting things to work. I faced several challenges and lots of learning during each of them.</p>

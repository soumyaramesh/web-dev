<h4>Blog..HTML5 Experiments</h4>
<p> This week I was introduced to the new elements and semantics of HTML5. I initally experimented with the Audio and Video elements in HTML5. I followed it up with 4 more experiments later that week.</p>
<h5>HTML5 Audio and Video</h5>
In this experiment, I demonstrated some of the new media elements in HTML5 such as audio, video and youtube video embedding in a web page.
<h5>HTML5 New Semantic Elements</h5>
In this experiment, I demonstrated a few new HTML5 semantic elements such as section, article, mark, nav, details and summary elements.
<h5>HTML5 New Input Types</h5>
In this experiment, I demonstrated a few new HTML5 form input types such as color,url,number,date and range.
<h5>HTML5 New Form Elements</h5>
In this experiment, I demonstrated a few new HTML5 form elements such as datalist, keygen and output. keygen is a concept that I didn't understand completely, but I got a brief overview of what it does.
<h5>A Simple Responsive Page</h5>
In this experiment, I built a simple responsive page. On resizing the window, the contents of the page would respond to the viewport size.
<h4>Summary</h4>
I was introduced to the new features of HTML5 this week. I focused all my experiments on the new elements on the new features that were introduced in HTML5 that were not present earlier. The media elements interested me the most.

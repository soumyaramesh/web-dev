<h4>Blog... Experiments with Angular JS </h4>
<hr/>
<p>
This week I did 4 experiments on Angular JS. The last experiment is comparitively complex compared than the rest, hence I stopped at 4 experiments.
</p>
<h5>Simple AngularJS Routing</h5>
<p>This is my first AngularJS app with a simple navigation bar as demonstrated in Prof. Jose's lectures. I added the ngRoute module as a dependency to my app and configured the RouteProvider to render the view depending on the state stored in the url.</p>
<h5>Loading Data from the Server</h5>
<p>Last week, I learnt how to display our controller’s data in our view and now, I have learnt to actually fetch live data from a RESTful server. I used the ergast API to obtain information about the current F-1 Championship Standings.</p>
<h5>Adding a Search Filter</h5>
<p>In this experiment, I have extended the previous experiment bysome functionality by implementing a simple text search input which will filters the list based on The Driver's name or Driver's team name.</p>
<h5>F-1 Championship Standings App</h5>
<p>Extending the previous experiment, I created a driver details page which will let us click on each driver and see his/her career details.</p>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>I found this week to be the most challenging so far, at the same time, the most knowledgable. I recreated every experiment and took help from Prof Jose's experiments and online sources. Despite all the sources, I faced several isuues and debugged them. The most challenging experiment was building the final app. I learnt a lot of new concepts, modules and directives of AngularJS. Even though I am disappointed that I could not do 5 experiments this week, my learning has been twice as any other week so far.</p>

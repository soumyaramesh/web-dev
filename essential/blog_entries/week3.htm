<h4>Blog... Experiments with JavaScript and jQuery</h4>
<hr/>
<p>
This week I did 5 experiments in JavaScript and jQuery.
</p>
<h5>Rock Paper Scissors!</h5>
<p>This experiment uses a form to obtain user input and on submit, executes a javascript script to produce the result of the game. This experiment helped me learn the basics of JavaScript such as the control flow elements and understanding the DOM model.</p>
<h5>Stack of Paragraphs</h5>
<p>I learnt about the z-index property and used Javascript to change the z-index of the corresponding paragraph's style when the mouse is hovered over it, thus making it visible on the top of the stack of paragraphs.</p>
<h5>Index of First Vowel in the string</h5>
<p>This experiment uses a form to obtain a user input string and on submit, executes a javascript script to produce the index of the first vowel in the string and the vowel. I learnt about arrays, for loops, using methods such as .indexOf, .charAt.</p>
<h5>Fading In and Out</h5>
<p>This is my first jQuery experiment. I learnt that $( ) marks the start of a jQuery object. $(document) is a jQuery object for the HTML document and .ready means that the function action take place when the document is loaded and ready and performed some basic fading in and out effects. </p>
<h5>To-Do List</h5>
<p>In this experiment, I built a To-Do list using jQuery. An item can be added by entering the item in the text box and clicking Add. An item can be removed by clicking on that item. I learnt to dynamically modify HTML elements by adding a new div on each addition of a new item into the list.</p>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>I learnt the basics of JavaScript and jQuery, both of which are new concepts to me. I found jQuery to be fascinating because of the variety of effects it allows you to add to your page.</p>

    This week, I completed my project! I added the follow/unfollow feature and worked on the layout. 
    Since I had my Algorithms course finals on 15th, I couldn't dedicate a lot of time to my project this week. I could have done a much better job with the UI given time.
    Irrespective of that, I had a great time working on this project.
    I must convey my sincere regards to Prof. Jose for such an excellent course.
    I consider it one of my best courses at NEU.
    This class was exactly the experience that I was looking forward to during my Master's course.
    The lectures were well organized and I enjoyed doing all the experiments and my project.
    I took up the course intending to gain practical experience using web technologies like Angular and NodeJS and this course couldn't have been better!

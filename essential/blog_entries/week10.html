<h4>Blog... Project Related Experiments 2 </h4>
<hr />
<p>
    This week, I continued my project related experiments. I made some progress with the core functionality.
   
</p>

<h5>User Profile View</h5>
<p>
    This week, I have started working on the remaining views in my project such as the user view, post view and tag view. <br />
    In this experiment, I have built the user profile view which shows the user account information such as username, posts by the user and the user's followers.
</p>
<h5> Tag View </h5>
<p>
    In this experiment, I have built the tag view which displays all posts belonging to s particular tag. When the user clicks a tag name on the home page, all posts with that particular tag are listed along with their upvote count, post title and author.
    <br />
    I have made this information public, irrespective of whether the user has logged in or not.
</p>
<h5> Post details View </h5>
<p>
    In this experiment, I setup the Post Details page which displays a post's information such as the post title, author, tag and upvote count. Along with that, I have provided a section for the list of comments for that post and provided a form for a user to enter a new comment.
    <br />
    A user can post a comment only when he is logged in. The comments can be upvoted and downvoted as well.
</p>
<h5> Add a new Post </h5>
<p>
    In this experiment, I created a new form for an authenticated logged in user to add a new post. The new post is saved in the database and dynamically added to the list of posts which are updated on the home page.
</p>
<h5> Upvote and Downvote Comments</h5>
<p>
    In this experiment, I have created the functionality for an authenticated logged in user to upvote or downvote a comment. I have added two bootstrap glyphicons for the upvote and downvote symbols.
</p>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>This week was quite slow for me, but progressive nonetheless. I am concentraing on the functionality rather than desigm at this point. I hope to catch up soon!</p>

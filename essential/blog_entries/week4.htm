<h4>Blog... Experiments with jQuery UI and Angular JS </h4>
<hr/>
<p>
This week I did 5 experiments in jQuery UI and Angular JS
</p>
<h5>jQuery UI Accordion</h5>
<p>In T=this experiment, I learnt to use the accordion widget of jQuery UI which displays headers with collapsible content panels for presenting information in a limited amount of space. I experimented with several options such as active, animate, collapsible, event, header, heighStyle and so on.</p>
<h5>jQuery Resizable</h5>
<p>In this experiment, I learnt to use the Resizable widget in jQuery in which you can change the size of an element by dragging with a mouse. I experimented with options such as maxHeight, ghost, autoHide and alsoResize.</p>
<h5>Navigation Menu using AngularJS</h5>
<p>This was my first experiment using AngularJS. I learnt about the AngularJS framework that binds HTML to JavaScript objects. I built a navigation menu using Angular JS. The selected menu item is highlighted.</p>
<h5>Inline Editor using Angular JS</h5>
<p>In this experiment, I built an inline editor where clicking the paragraph "Edit me" will show a tooltip with a text field. I learnt about controllers. Controllers are regular JavaScript functions which are executed automatically by Angular, and which are associated with your page using the ng-controller directive.</p>
<h5>Order Form using Angular JS</h5>
<p>In this experiment, I created an order form with a total price updated in real time, using one of Angular’s useful features – filters. Filters allow you to modify models and can be chained together using the pipe character |. I experimented with the currency filter.</p>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>Last week, I did only a couple of experiments using jQuery. This week, I tried a few more jQuery UI experiments like using the Accordion and Resizable widgets. I then started to learn about AngularJS, which I found to be very vast. I had to familiarize myself with new concepts and understand models and controllers and how the framework updates modifications in real time. I built a navigation menu, an inline editor and an order form.</p>

<h4>Blog... Experiments with MongoDB </h4>
<hr />
<p>
    This week I did 5 experiments using MongoDB.
</p>
<h5> Display data from MongoDB </h5>
<p>This week is similar to last week's experiments, except that instead of using static data, I have used MongoDB to fetch and insert data.
         In this experiment, I have inserted some book information into the database and retrieved them and displayed it in a table.</p>
<h5>Delete a Book from the Database</h5>
<p>
    This experiment is an extension of the previous experiment where I have created a new button to delete a book from the database. On clicking the delete button, the record for that book is deleted from the database.
</p>
<h5> Insert new book to the database</h5>
<p>
    This experiment is an extension of the previous experiment where I have added 2 other buttons: one to add a new book and another to select and edit a particular book. When the edit button is clicked, it's value is copied onto the form, this is known as copy by reference.
</p>
<h5> Adding Chapters for a book</h5>
<p>
    This experiment is an extension of the previous experiment where I have added a new button to add a chapter for a book when it is selected.
    For a selected book, it's chapters are displayed in a table. When the add button is clicked for a particular chapter, the chapters array of that Book is updated in the database.
</p>
<h5> Deleting chapter for a book</h5>
<p>
    This experiment is an extension of the previous experiment where I have added new buttons to delete each chapter of a book when it is selected.
    When the delete button is clicked for a particular chapter, it's index is obtained and spliced from the nested chapters list.
</p>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>This week was very taxing, but interesting. I started with NodeJMongoDB from the scratch with guidance from Prof Jose's lectures. It was time consuming to understand the architecture and re-implement the experiments that were demonstrated in class. I faced some issues while installing mongoose which took up most of my time. Apart from that, I learnt several new concepts.</p>

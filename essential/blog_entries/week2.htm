<h4>Blog... Experiments with Bootstrap</h4>
<hr/>
<p>
This week I did 5 experiments involving CSS with Bootstrap.
</p>
<h5>My First Simple Bootstrap Page</h5>
<p>I built my first simple responsive bootstrap page with 2 containers: one with a fixed width and another with a non-fixed with that spans the entire page. The window can be resized to observe the responsive behaviour of the page.</p>
<h5>Bootstrap Navbar</h5>
<p>I learnt to build a nvaigation bar using Bootstrap which contains navigational links at the top of the page. This experiment made me understand how it is simple and beautiful to render a navigation bar using Bootstrap.</p>
<h5>Bootstrap Grid examples</h5>
<p>I leant how the Bootstrap grid system functions. Bootstrap allows for a responsive, fluid grid system that scales up to 12 columns corresponding to the increase or decrease of the viewport size. The Grid systems is used to create page layouts whose content is housed in the form of rows and columns.</p>
<h5>Bootstrap Buttons</h5>
<p>I designed a few types of buttons and experimented with the size, types, icons and built a button toolbar.</p>
<h5>Bootstrap Alerts</h5>
<p>I learnt to use basic alerts. Alerts are used to provide feedback to user actions. Include any text and an optional dismiss button in .alert and one of the four contextual classes: alert-success, alert-info, alert-warning, alert-danger. I also experimented with dismissible alerts and alerts containing links.</p>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>Bootstrap is a completely new concept to me. I took a while to learn and implement basic features. I found it fascinating because of its ease and design sophistication.</p>

        <h3>About the Experiment</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px">This experiment demonstrates the accordion widget of jQuery UI which displays headers with collapsible content panels for presenting information in a limited amount of space. This is a more sophisticated way of representing details and summary based on the user's choice. The accordion widget also provides several options which are discussed below.</p>
        <div id="accordion">
            <h3>Section 1</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Far over the Misty Mountains cold
                    To dungeons deep, and caverns old
                    We must away ere break of day
                    To seek the pale enchanted gold.

                    The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,
                    While hammers fell like ringing bells
                    In places deep, where dark things sleep,
                    In hollow halls beneath the fells.

                    For ancient king and elvish lord,
                    There many a gleaming golden hoard
                    They shaped and wrought, and light they caught
                    To hide in gems on hilt of sword.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Section 2</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    On silver necklaces they strung
                    The flowering stars, on crowns they hung
                    The dragon-fire, in twisted wire
                    They meshed the light of moon and sun.

                    Far over the misty mountains cold
                    To dungeons deep and caverns old
                    We must away, ere break of day,
                    To claim our long-forgotten gold.

                    Goblets they carved there for themselves
                    And harps of gold; where no man delves
                    There lay they long, and many a song
                    Was sung unheard by men or elves.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Section 3</h3>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>The pines were roaring on the height,
                        The winds were moaning in the night.
                        The fire was red, it flaming spread;</li>
                    <li>The trees like torches blazed with light.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>Section 4</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The bells were ringing in the dale
                    And men looked up with faces pale;
                    Then dragon's ire more fierce than fire
                    Laid low their towers and houses frail.

                    The mountain smoked beneath the moon;
                    The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.
                    They fled their hall to dying fall
                    Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.

                    Far over the misty mountains grim
                    To dungeons deep and caverns dim
                    We must away, ere break of day,
                    To win our harps and gold from him!
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

            <h4>Code Snippet:</h4>

            <pre style="background-color:palegoldenrod"><code>$(document).ready(function() {
        $("#accordion").accordion({
        active: 1,
        heightStyle: "content",
        collapsible: true
        });
    });
</code></pre>
        </p>

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <div style="background-color:antiquewhite">#accordion is the id for each header. $("#accordion").accordion is used to reference the headers with id="accordion" and .accordion is used to convert a pair of headers and content panels into an accordion.
         We can specify several options such as active, animate, collapsible, event, header, heighStyle and so on. Here, I have experimented with active, heighStyle and collapsible.
        <ul>
            <li>active is used to specify which header should be active when the accordion is loaded. Since I have specified active:1, the second panel is active. 0 is for the first panel.</li>
            <li>heighStyle has 3 options. "content" is used when the height of the panel is according to that of the content size. "auto" is used when all panels will be set to the height of the tallest panel and "fill" is used to expand to the available height based on the accordion's parent height.</li>
            <li>collapsible is used when all the sections can be closed at once. It allows to collapse the active section, which is not possible in the default setting where at least one panel will be active.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

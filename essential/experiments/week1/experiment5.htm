                    Far over the misty mountains cold
                    To dungeons deep, and caverns old
                    We must away ere break of day
                    To seek the pale enchanted gold.

                    The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,
                    While hammers fell like ringing bells
                    In places deep, where dark things sleep,
                    In hollow halls beneath the fells.

                    For ancient king and elvish lord,
                    There many a gleaming golden hoard
                    They shaped and wrought, and light they caught
                    To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

                    Under the Mountain dark and tall

                    The King has come unto his hall!

                    His foe is dead, the Worm of Dread,
                    And ever so his foes shall fall.
                </p>

                    The sword is sharp, the spear is long,
                    The arrow swift, the Gate is strong;
                    The heart is bold that looks on gold;
                    The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong.

                    The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,
                    While hammers fell like ringing bells
                    In places deep, where dark things sleep,
                    In hollow halls beneath the fells.

                    On silver necklaces they strung
                    The light of stars, on crowns they hung
                    The dragon-fire, from twisted wire
                    The melody of harps they wrung.

                    The mountain throne once more is freed!
                    O! wandering folk, the summons heed!
                    Come haste! Come haste! across the waste!
                    The king of friend and kin has need.
                </p>

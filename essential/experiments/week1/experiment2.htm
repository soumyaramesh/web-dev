        <h3>About the Experiment</h3>
        <p>I have demonstrated a few new HTML5 semantic elements such as section, article, mark, nav, details and summary elements</p>
    </fieldset>

    <fieldset>
        <h3 style="color:darkblue">The &lt;section&gt; element</h3>
        <p> A section is typically a content group with a heading</p>

        <section>
            <h4> A section</h4>
            Far over the misty mountains cold
            To dungeons deep, and caverns old
            We must away ere break of day
            To seek the pale enchanted gold.

            The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,
            While hammers fell like ringing bells
            In places deep, where dark things sleep,
            In hollow halls beneath the fells.

            For ancient king and elvish lord,
            There many a gleaming golden hoard
            They shaped and wrought, and light they caught
            To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

            On silver necklaces they strung
            The flowering stars, on crowns they hung
            The dragon-fire, in twisted wire
            They meshed the light of moon and sun.

        <section>
            <h4>Another section</h4>
            Far over the misty mountains cold
            To dungeons deep and caverns old
            We must away, ere break of day,
            To claim our long-forgotten gold.

            Goblets they carved there for themselves
            And harps of gold; where no man delves
            There lay they long, and many a song
            Was sung unheard by men or elves.

            The pines were roaring on the height,
            The winds were moaning in the night.
            The fire was red, it flaming spread;

            The trees like torches blazed with light.

            The bells were ringing in the dale
            And men looked up with faces pale;
            Then dragon's ire more fierce than fire
            Laid low their towers and houses frail.

            The mountain smoked beneath the moon;
            The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.
            They fled their hall to dying fall
            Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.

            Far over the misty mountains grim
            To dungeons deep and caverns dim
            We must away, ere break of day,
            To win our harps and gold from him!

            Code Snippet:
            <pre style="background-color:lightgoldenrodyellow">
  
            &lt;section&gt;
            Your section content.
            &lt;/section&gt;
        </pre>
        </p>

        <h3 style="color:darkblue">The &lt;article&gt; element</h3>
        <p>An article is usually an independent content that makes sense on it's own and is independent of the rest of the site content.</p>
        <article style="background-color:palegreen">

            <h4>Did you know?</h4>
            If you have 3 quarters, 4 dimes, and 4 pennies, you have $1.19. You also have the largest amount of money in coins without being able to make change for a dollar.
        </article>

        <p>
            Code Snippet:
            <pre style="background-color:lightgoldenrodyellow">
  
            &lt;article&gt;
            Your article content.
            &lt;/article&gt;
        </pre>
        </p>

        <h3 style="color:darkblue">The &lt;nav&gt; element</h3>
        <p>The nav element is used to provide navigational links. I have demonstrated nav in the References section.</p>

        <p>
            Code Snippet:
            <pre style="background-color:lightgoldenrodyellow">
  
            &lt;nav&gt;
            &lt;a href="navigation-link1"&gt;link1&lt;a&gt;
            &lt;a href="navigation-link2"&gt;link2&lt;a&gt;
            &lt;/nav&gt;
        </pre>
        </p>

        <h3 style="color:darkblue">The &lt;mark&gt; element</h3>
        <p>This element is used to <mark>highlight</mark> some part of text as shown in this example.</p>

        <p>
            Code Snippet:
            <pre style="background-color:lightgoldenrodyellow">
  
            &lt;p&gt;
            Your &lt;mark&gt; highlight &lt;/mark&gt; content.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        </pre>
        </p>

        <h3 style="color:darkblue">The &lt;details&gt; and &lt;summary&gt; elements</h3>
        <p>These elements are used to hide and view details by proving a visible summary for the details.</p>
        <details style="background-color:aquamarine">
            <summary>The Misty Mountains Cold Lyrics.</summary>
            <p>
                Far over the misty mountains cold

                To seek the pale enchanted gold.

            <pre style="background-color:lightgoldenrodyellow">
  
            &lt;details&gt;
            &lt;summary&gt; summary text &lt;/summary&gt;
            &lt;p&gt; Detail content &lt;/p&gt;

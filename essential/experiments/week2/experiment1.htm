    <h1>My First BootStrap Page!</h1>
    <fieldset>
        <h3>About the Experiment</h3>
        <p>This is my first Bootstrap page. The first example represents a responsive fixed width container and the second example demonstrates a responsive container that spans to the full window width.</p>
    </fieldset>
    
    <div class="container">
        <section>
            <h3> A container with fixed width</h3>
            Far over the misty mountains cold
            To dungeons deep, and caverns old
            We must away ere break of day
            To seek the pale enchanted gold.

            The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,
            While hammers fell like ringing bells
            In places deep, where dark things sleep,
            In hollow halls beneath the fells.

            For ancient king and elvish lord,
            There many a gleaming golden hoard
            They shaped and wrought, and light they caught
            To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

            On silver necklaces they strung
            The flowering stars, on crowns they hung
            The dragon-fire, in twisted wire
            They meshed the light of moon and sun.

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <h3>A Container with full-width span</h3>
        <p>
            The mountain throne once more is freed!
            O! wandering folk, the summons heed!
            Come haste! Come haste! across the waste!
            The king of friend and kin has need.

            Now call we over mountains cold,
            ‘Come back unto the caverns old’!
            Here at the Gates the king awaits,
            His hands are rich with gems and gold.
            The king is come unto his hall
            Under the Mountain dark and tall.
            The Worm of Dread is slain and dead,
            And ever so our foes shall fall!
